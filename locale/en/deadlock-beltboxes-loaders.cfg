[entity-description]
deadlock-loader=Quickly transfers resources between belts and inventories. Rotate after placement to change input/output mode.
deadlock-beltbox=Stacks/unstacks some resources and products, enabling 5x compression on belts.

[technology-name]
deadlock-stacking=Stacking

[technology-description]
deadlock-stacking=Unlocks stacking beltboxes, which can boost belt throughput for specific resources.

deadlock-enable-beltboxes=Enable Beltboxes
deadlock-enable-loaders=Enable Loaders
deadlock-stacking-auto-unstack=Auto unstack

deadlock-loaders-snap-to-inventories=Snap loaders to inventories
deadlock-loaders-snap-to-belts=Snap loaders to belts
deadlock-stacking-batch-stacking=Batch stacking

[mod-setting-description]
deadlock-stacking-auto-unstack=Automatically unstack any stacks picked up from the ground or belts.
deadlock-stacking-hide-unstacking=Removes unstacking recipes from the player crafting tab. This prevents you from "hand-unstacking" but removes a lot of clutter.
deadlock-loaders-snap-to-inventories=Loaders will automatically input into inventories on their loader-end and output from inventories on their belt-end when placed
deadlock-loaders-snap-to-belts=Loaders will automatically rotate and change mode based on the position and facing of any belts present on their belt-end
deadlock-stacking-batch-stacking=Beltboxes will process stacks in batches of 4, loading belts evenly and increasing throughput with extremely high speed modded belts
